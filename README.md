## Background
In this project we are using a movie dataset of 50,000 data entries. We will be using kNN, logistic regression and a support vector machine. It will be written in python and will display the features/attributes, class distribution, and dataset partition. The program will also display Confusion matrices for kNN, logistic regression, and SVM.
